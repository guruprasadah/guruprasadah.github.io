I'm back, again.

This..... is just the way I write a record. I write it for a few days, folllowed by loong (usually years) periods of silence.

So, the last time I wrote, there was the virus - and the world was mostly peaceful. But now, THERES A FREAKING WAR!! I mean, come on!! You the world can't just go from mellow-kitty :kissing_cat: to straight up zombie apocalypse mode :rage2:, cause that's bad for health. At this point, I'm pretty convinced that this world is a simulation, and that the world is just a toy for the enjoyment of someone. Taking inspiration from this, I've created a theory:

> The universe is in a state of constant deterioration

At first, this may seem like a crackpot-cuckoo :bird: theory, but think about it - the universe has just gotten worser and worser. First, it was G-Rated, then 13+, then Mature - and then now, it is R.

That's all.
