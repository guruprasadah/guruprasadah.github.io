# Catharsis

Catharsis is a wonderful thing. It may get rid of your sadness, almost always at a cost.

Cost - a word which varies wildly with context. Cost, in this context may either mean letting others know about your emotions - or doing something you truly love, letting out emotions in the process.

Didn't catch a single word right? Well, let me introduce to you Inception.

Inception is built on top of this very subject. The means of bending Fischer to their will is simple - get him to Cathart his emotions of the strained relationship with his father to use it as a manipulative means - a boost of some sorts - in the needed direction.

Catharsis plays an important part of out lives. Emotions bottled up inside that mind of yours can lead to an overboost - i.e taking a very rash decision when you eventually do it unwillingfully.

And what was the purpose of this blog post? Well, its what you've been reading about. I like messing around with complex computer stuff, so I chose this means as a way of catharting.

Till next time
